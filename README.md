# jira-link-extension

This is just a little extension for Chrome that will link JIRA ticket
names in PR bodies and titles to the appropriate JIRA ticket.

Clone this repo, and then install as a Developer-mode Chrome extension.
Maybe one day I'll get around to actually making it configurable and
submitting it, but I haven't done so yet.
